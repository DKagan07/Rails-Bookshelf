# Your Bookshelf!

This is an app powered by Ruby on Rails to check-in and monitor your books.

Things you may want to cover:

  * Tracks book titles, authors, whether you've read them yet, and a small, user-imputted synopsis.

  * Full Auth capabilities with the Devise gem

  * CRUD functionality with books for each user

  * Cannot update, edit, or delete books without being logged in

  * Built for fun!
